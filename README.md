# Trading Bot Project

This is a project in wich i am learning to build trading bots

There is currently a moving average crossover strategy (MAC.py)
And there is a candlestick retriever wich retrieves candlesticks from the MEXC trading platform

# start up code

Run the main.py with the code under #MA Crossover uncommented or the candlestick retriever code uncommented
